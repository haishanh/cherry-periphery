Peripheries for [Cherry](https://github.com/haishanh/cherry)

- `packages/ext`, Cherry Chrome and Firefox extension.
- `packages/site`, Cherry website.
- `packages/app`, this is a Git submodule point to the [main Cherry app](https://github.com/haishanh/cherry). It's here because our extension depends on some UI components exported from the main repo.
